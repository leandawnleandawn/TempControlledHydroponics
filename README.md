# DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED NUTRIENT FILM TECHNIQUE (NFT) HYDROPONIC SYSTEM OF SILING LABUYO (Capsicum frutescens)

## Abstract

This project focuses on the design and development of a Temperature Controlled Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) Hydroponics System for cultivating Siling Labuyo (Capsicum frutescens). The primary objective is to enhance urban agricultural practices through innovative use of sensors, controllers, and actuators, thereby promoting water and space efficiency. The system aims to provide a viable solution for urban farmers who face space constraints and harsh weather conditions, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 2, which targets zero hunger and promotes sustainable agriculture
The project follows the CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate) approach. In the conception phase, existing hydroponic systems were analyzed to establish design requirements. The design phase involved creating detailed Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models and electronic schematics to integrate mechanical, electronic, and control systems tailored for the NFT Hydroponics setup. Implementation focused on assembling the system using materials such as PVC pipes, water pumps, and temperature control mechanisms, within a budgetary constraint of 5,000 pesos
Performance evaluation of the system indicated that the chosen components and control strategies, including bang-bang control for the temperature actuator, effectively maintained optimal growing conditions for Siling Labuyo. The system demonstrated significant improvements in water usage efficiency and the reliability of temperature regulation. Statistical analysis revealed an ultrasonic sensor accuracy of 8.84% and a PT1000 sensor accuracy of 12.73%, ensuring precise monitoring of water levels and temperature respectively
This project's findings underscore the potential of controlled hydroponic systems to enhance urban agriculture, contributing to food security and sustainable practices. It also provides a practical framework for further innovations in sensor integration and control mechanisms in agricultural engineering
